# Steps to Launch and Configure an EC2 Instance on AWS

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console:**
   - Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
   - Sign in using your AWS account credentials.

2. **Navigate to EC2:**
   - In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 dashboard. You can find it under the "Compute" section or by searching for "EC2" in the search bar.

3. **Launch Instance:**
   - Click on the "Launch Instance" button to start the process.

4. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):**
   - Select the type of operating system and software configuration you want for your instance. AWS provides various pre-configured AMIs, including different Linux distributions, Windows Server, etc.

5. **Choose an Instance Type:**
   - Select the hardware configuration (CPU, memory, storage, etc.) for your instance. This depends on your application's requirements and workload.

6. **Configure Instance Details:**
   - Here you can specify details like the number of instances you want to launch, network settings, IAM role, monitoring options, etc. You can leave most settings as default if you're just getting started.

7. **Add Storage:**
   - Specify the size and type of storage (EBS volumes) you want to attach to your instance. You can also configure additional settings like encryption.

8. **Add Tags (Optional):**
   - Optionally, you can add tags to your instance to help organize and manage your resources.

9. **Configure Security Group:**
   - Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your EC2 instances. Define rules to control incoming and outgoing traffic. For example, you might open port 80 for HTTP traffic or port 22 for SSH.

10. **Review and Launch:**
    - Review your instance configuration to ensure everything is set up correctly. Then, click "Launch" to proceed.

11. **Select/Create Key Pair:**
    - If you haven't already, you'll need to create or select an existing key pair. This key pair is used for SSH access to your instance. Download the private key file (.pem) and keep it secure.

12. **Launch Instances:**
    - Once you've selected a key pair, click "Launch Instances" to launch your EC2 instances.

13. **Accessing Your Instance:**
    - Once the instance is running, you can access it via SSH (for Linux instances) or RDP (for Windows instances) using the public IP address or public DNS provided in the EC2 dashboard.
